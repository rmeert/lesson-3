      <p>Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.</p>

    <h2>2. This is a photo of a cat.</h2>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like width: 100%;. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like font-family: monospace;.</p>

    <h2>3. This is a big link</h2>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.</p>
